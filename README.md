# Getting Started

In order to use this sample code you must set your ioc file to use ADC input and PWM output. You can loosely follow the first part of this tutorial here https://controllerstech.com/control-servo-rpm-using-potentiometer/ for a sample. You can copy the main.c file in this repository and change the timer and channel for the PWM accordingly and it should work well.
